#### My academic journey:
* Year- <i>I started my BSc at Dalhousie University in 2021, so I am now in my 5th year!</i> 5️⃣
* Major- <i>I was originally a Chemistry major, but after my 2nd year I switched to a major in Psychology!</i> 🧠
#### Why Psychology?
I became interested in Psychology after taking PSYO1031 as an elective in my 2nd year! 😊
#### Why PSYO3505?
I chose to take this course for multiple reasons! 🌟
1. <i>I needed 3000+ level Psychology courses to fulfill my major requirement</i> ✅
2. <i>This course was available, looked interesting, and had started on time</i> 😅
3. <i>My partner is in his 5th year of a Computer Science major, so I thought it would be cool to learn a bit about what he does</i> 💗
#### My future goals:
After I graduate, I plan to get my BEd from the University of Prince Edward Island and become an elementary school teacher 🏫
